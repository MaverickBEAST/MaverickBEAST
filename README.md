My name is Bhanuka😁 and I'm an Information Technology undergraduate at [General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University](https://kdu.ac.lk/).

😋 I started this journey in late 2016 and have been at it since. Currently I'm in my 4th and Final year and Seeking Internship for my industrial training.

🌎 The world of `Programming` 🤖 had always fascinated me for a very long time. Ever since my only dream 🙃 was to be a Software Engneer and help Build Software that millions of people use, for instance a 🚗 taxi booking app, a food delivery 🍔 app or some online 💵 payment app. 

🐱‍👤 I'm really interested in Java, Android Development, C#, Javascript Frameworks like ReactJS, Angular and NodeJs I strongly believe these technologies is going to transform the world in the near future not limited to above mentioned. Currently a lot of  🕸️ web apps that are built behave more like mobile 📱 app and show real-time data. In the near future the web is going to be a huge setup that will link most of the IoT devices together.

👦🏻 I got into Programming around 5 years ago until then I was a Multimedia designer with around 2 years of experience. at the beginning I was not a good coder 👨🏽‍💻 as such. I could hardly write a `Java Program` and could not even understand many use-cases 😷 of these programs. Probably because I was not much of a book worm 🐛. Things changed in the year 2017 and my fascination towards programming increased and at the end of year 2017 I started programming with a real `Ambition`to be a a Brilliant Programmer. Today I'm at my end of University life and Waiting for My Industrial Training. I'm leaning towards `Software Development` and `Full Stack Web Development` 👨🏽‍💻 working with multiple technologies and broaden my knowledge of industry and Technology is primary goal in my Industrial period. Currently I work with mostly `Java` `C#` and `Javascript`. but mostly `JavaScript` Frameworks like `ReactJS`,`Angular` and Runtime Enviroments like `NodeJS`. I'm open to discussions on various Java, C# and Javascript technologies.
